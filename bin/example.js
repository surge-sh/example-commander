// Now, letâ€™s add a hook. There are a variety of pre- and

// documented here: [TODO]

// This `preAuth` hook runs each time before checking
// someone is logged in.

// Here, we can add a `postProject` hook to run before
// after the project directory has been determined, but
// before it has been publish. This is incredibly useful if
// you are making any kind of build tool or static site generator:
// your library can compile any files here before moving onto the
// next step.

// can use our example CLI successfully. Remember, these
// commands can be named whatever you want or used within
// other commands, depending on what your specific tool does.
